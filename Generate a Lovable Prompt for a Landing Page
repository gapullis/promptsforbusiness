Generate a Lovable Prompt for a Landing Page

Your new mission
From all the information in the conversation above, your new mission is to generate the best possible Lovable.dev prompt for creating a high-converting landing page.

This landing page must perfectly reflect the customer's pain points, language, and motivations, using the Before-After-Bridge (BAB) copywriting framework. It must also follow Lovable's best practices for structured prompts to ensure a clean, functional, and visually appealing landing page.

Your role is both an expert copywriter and a Lovable.dev landing page creation expert.


Think step by step
Summarize the key pain points, motivations, and desires expressed in the conversation.
Extract the best possible customer wording from the AI-generated business insights to maintain authenticity.
Craft a landing page structure that follows Lovable’s best UI/UX practices and adheres to conversion best practices.
Generate the perfect Lovable.dev prompt, ensuring the AI produces not only great copy but also an effective design.


Landing Page Structure (Follow this format in the Lovable Prompt)
1️⃣ Above the Fold (First Section)
This is the first thing the visitor sees when landing on the page. It must be immediately clear what the product is, who it’s for, and why it matters.

Headline: (Use customer’s exact wording when possible)
Can be one of these:
A short, direct statement of what the product does
A powerful question that resonates with the visitor’s pain
A vision of the desired outcome
Subheadline: Clarifies the offer in simple words, mentioning:
Who it’s for
What problem it solves
How it’s different or easier than other solutions
Bullet Points: 3-5 benefits of the product (each backed by a feature).
Call to Action (CTA): Simple, action-driven button text.


2️⃣ Current Pain (The "Before")
This section vividly describes the visitor’s current struggles, making them feel seen and understood.

Title: A question or statement that instantly connects with the visitor’s situation.
3 Pain Points: Short paragraphs painting scenes of frustration (use customer wording!).
Belief Deconstruction: Breaks the visitor’s false assumptions about the problem (e.g., why past solutions haven’t worked).


3️⃣ Desired Outcome (The "After")
Now, shift the focus to what life looks like once the problem is solved.

Title: A call to imagine their transformed life.
3 Outcome Blocks: Short descriptions of the new reality, linked to emotions.
New Paradigm Introduction: Introduce a new way to solve the problem—setting up the product as the breakthrough.


4️⃣ Introducing the Product
Now, finally introduce the offer.

Product Name + Short Description
3-Step Process: If applicable, outline how it works in 3 simple steps.
Message from the Founder: A personal statement to humanize the product.
Final CTA Block: Last push to get the visitor to take action (with urgency).


Lovable.dev Best Practices (Incorporate These in the Lovable Prompt!)
Be extremely clear in the request (no vague instructions like "make a good landing page").
Specify structure upfront (above-the-fold, pain points, solution, CTA, etc.).
Ensure strong CTA placement (e.g., after key sections).
Specify a clean, conversion-optimized design (modern UI, clear typography, mobile-friendly layout).
Use Lovable’s integrations wisely (e.g., include a contact form, email collection, Stripe for payments if relevant).


Now, Generate the Lovable.dev Prompt
Now, based on all the insights gathered, write a Lovable.dev prompt that will generate a full landing page that follows the structure above, using the customer’s own words wherever possible.

The Lovable prompt must:

Clearly instruct Lovable to create a landing page.
Include all the required sections and design instructions.
Use the customer’s own wording for headlines, pain points, and outcomes.
Ensure mobile responsiveness and a professional aesthetic.

Output:
A full Lovable.dev prompt that the user can copy and paste into Lovable to generate a fully functional, high-converting landing page.
